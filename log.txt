The following is a log of my work on the skills assessment.

Taking some time to read up on the express and debug modules...

OK... here's what it looks like we're dealing with.
- Server listens on port 3000 while running
- When a post is made to /api/usages, server catches the payload and appends it as is to the usages array
- Server looks at the length of the array and calls that the id for this call
- Response echoes back the id in a simple json payload

Potential areas of concern
- Most obviously, the array strictly grows.  That'll be an issue, so let's get some buffering on that.  One presumes in a real life scenario we'd be deserializing the payloads before handing them off to a database, but for this purpose a simple log file will be a sufficient stand-in.
- If the array no longer grows to eternity, we'll need to separately track the ID that we hand back.  We'll need to ensure competing over that resource doesn't block the thread.
- Express has some good general tips here https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html.  At least some of that is relevant.
